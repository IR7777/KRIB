### We're still here
can you believe it's been **20 years**?  it took me this long to figure out that i can run a free website on [GitHub](https://github.com) so here we are. as part of this new website, here are some things that are no longer of *immediate* interest:

- taking over the world
- keying **Îš** into furniture, walls, doors, etc. 
- no longer vandalizing pledge paddles, simply because there are none of those around.

some things that *are* of immediate interest:

- figure out GitHub
- figure out how to write in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- start writing more
- learn more about technology and some new skills
- learn how to publish with my iPad
- revive some of the stuff that was oposted on original krib.org website all those years ago
- *eventually* figure out how to take over the world.

if you'd like to contribute something to here or just want to shoot the shit in general you can [send me an email](mailto:iridium7777@mac.com).
