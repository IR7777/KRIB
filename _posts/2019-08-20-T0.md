### T0

willem turned 5 yesterday.  he climbed into bed with us in the morning, after waking up, and all i could think of is how big he is.  i can't believe it's been 5 years, but michelle and i did remeniss about the morning of his birth, how i was all dressed and ready to go to work when she said we needed to go to the hospital.  i replied something like "why don't we see how this goes, i'll go into work for a little and you can call me later", to which she replied something like **"we need to go right now!"**
