### T0

willem turned 5 yesterday.  he climbed into bed with us in the morning, after waking up, and all i could think of is how big he is already.  i can't believe it's been 5 years, but michelle and i did remeniss about the morning of his birth, how i was all dressed and ready to go to work when she said we needed to go to the hospital.  i replied something like "why don't we see how this goes, i'll go into work for a little and you can call me later", to which she replied something like **"we need to go right now!"**

he requested that we go to one of [his favorite restaurants](https://redcowmn.com/mpls-50th-street/)[^1], which is right by his daycare

[^1]: i'm not really spamming you with this restaurant, and although the kid loves it i think there are much better burger choices around in minneapolis. i'm also not really found of edina and generally do not want to promote anything to do with it.  but, what i am doing is learning markdown and this gives me an opportunity to practice footnotes :).
